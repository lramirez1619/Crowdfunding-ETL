# Crowdfunding-ETL

We are to create a DataFrame to be exported as a CSV fil to be used as a dataset for ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. The table will contain a CSV file that has the backersâ€™ information. A data analysis is performed on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

Technical analysis deliverables includes:
1.  Deliverable: Extract Data
2.  Deliverable: Transform and Clean Data
3.  Deliverable: Create an ERD and Table Schema, and Load Data
4.  Deliverable: SQL Analysis
